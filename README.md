MUSeo
=====

A small module for handle SEO better

SEO is important for websites.

Modules for Zikula have their own ways to create metatags like 'title', 'description' or 'keywords'.
Some Modules do not handle them at all.

The result is, that we get sites with the same title or description or keyword tag.

MUSeo will give a way to override or add metatags to the html code of any site of a website.
